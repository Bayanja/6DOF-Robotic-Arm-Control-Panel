# 6DOF-Robotic-Arm-Control-Panel
6 axis robotic arm control panel designed by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and connected to database. This task was implemented during my training with Smart Methods company. 

The first Task was divided into 4 sub tasks. The 1st sub-task was to design the control panel of the Robot Arm where the user can select the angle value for each motor.


The 2nd sub-task was to create a database to store the motors angles values.

The 3rd sub-task was to connect the database with the control panel.

The 4th sub-task was to create php page.
