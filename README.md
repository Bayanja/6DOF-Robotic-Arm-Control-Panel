# 6DOF-Robotic-Arm-Control-Panel
6 axis robotic arm control panel designed by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and connected to database. This task was implemented during my training with Smart Methods company. 

The first Task was divided into 4 sub tasks. The 1st sub-task was to design the control panel of the Robot Arm where the user can select the angle value for each motor.

The 2nd sub-task was to create a database to store the motors angles values in a table.

The final sub-task was to create php page and connect the database with the robot arm control panel. The connection was implented by using MYSQLi Extension of PHP as the following:
